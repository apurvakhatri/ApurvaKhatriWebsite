      <description>I am a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science Student at Northeastern University, Boston. I like computers and not just software, but all its aspects.
I have two years of work experience as a software developer. Working in a finance company which is not purely tech driven, I migrated their technology setup to AWS cloud and created several APIs. In my daily work, I am also involved with creation and maintenance of current services for their better optimization and performance.</description>
