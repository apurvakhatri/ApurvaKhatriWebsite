## About Me

Hi, I’m **Apurva Khatri** (pronounced *Ah-poor-vah Khuh-tree*), a software developer with a Master of Science in Computer Science from **Northeastern University**. With nearly three years of industry experience, I specialize in building scalable, reliable software systems and thrive at the intersection of backend engineering, DevOps, and cloud-native development.

### 🧑‍💻 Professional Experience

I've worked across industry and academia in full-stack and backend roles. At QuantUniversity, I developed a research assistant platform for educational content creation—leveraging React, FastAPI, MongoDB, and OpenAI APIs. As a Software Developer Intern at Bayer, I built a Python CI package used by multiple engineering teams and implemented a TPM-based credential store aligned with FDA compliance. Earlier at ICICI Lombard, I led efforts to migrate microservices to AWS, cutting deployment time by 90%, and built ELK-based centralized logging systems processing up to 6 GB of logs daily.

### 🎓 Education

I hold a **Master of Science in Computer Science** from Northeastern University, where I focused on systems design, software engineering, and cloud technologies. I earned my **B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering** from Vellore Institute of Technology in India.

### 🛠️ Technical Skills

- **Languages & Databases:** C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Scala, MySQL, MongoDB  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** .NET, REST APIs, Git, Linux, React, Django, Android Studio  
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Docker, Jenkins, JFrog, ELK Stack, AWS (ECS, S3, Bedrock), CI/CD pipelines  

### 🚀 Projects & Highlights

- **Stock Trading Platform:** Developed in Java using MVC architecture and design patterns (Command, Facade, Builder), with comprehensive unit and controller-level testing.
- **Learning Management Portal:** A full-stack app built with ReactJS, React Native, Node.js, and MongoDB to streamline course management and enhance user experience.
- **Voice Interaction Pipeline with AWS Bedrock:** Built an event-driven, serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and Bedrock to analyze customer audio recordings, gaining hands-on experience with **LLMs**, **GenAI**, and **event-driven systems**.

### 🧠 Beyond the Code

Outside of tech, I’m a curious and active person. I love **running**, **cooking**, and exploring topics like **sports**, **politics**, **psychology**, and—of course—**great food**.

### 🎯 Looking Ahead

- **Professionally**, I aspire to contribute to impactful, high-scale products, collaborate under strong technical leadership, and continue growing in full-stack and cloud development—ideally in a **hybrid work environment**.
- **Personally**, I’m training to run a **half marathon at the Boston Marathon in 2025**, a goal that keeps me motivated and grounded.
