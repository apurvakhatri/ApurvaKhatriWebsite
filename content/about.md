Graduate computer science student at **Northeastern University, Boston.** I am open to **software developer internship** starting Summer 2023 in the **United states.**

Currently studying Program Design Paradigm [CS5010] and Database Management Systems [CS5200] along with daily dose of **[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/apurvakhatri2011/).**

I hail from **Mumbai, India** where I have spent most of my time. Important years of my education were spent in different parts of India, which helped me grow sophisitcally as an individual. I like to stay at different places [Traveler as people would say], interact with diverse people and try every cuisine :) As much as I love food, I like sports and take pleasure in doing some sort of exercise in form of sports/gymanisum or anything to keep myself motivated.
