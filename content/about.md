I am a Master's in Computer Science Student at **Northeastern** University, Boston. I like computers and not just software, but all its aspects. 

I have two years of work experience as a software developer. Working in a finance company which is not purely tech driven, I migrated their technology setup to **AWS cloud** and created several APIs. In my daily work, I am also involved with creation and maintenance of current services for their better optimization and performance. 

I love sports and movies. 

Now since you're here, have a look at my **[Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NuaV_TZG-WZloDftnKl6ccddJ4VsY1vr/view?usp=sharing).**
