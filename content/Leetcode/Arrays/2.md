This problem can be solved using two approaches:

1. **Dynamic Programming**
   Time Complexity: **O(n²)**
   Space Complexity: **O(n²)**

2. **Two-Pointer (Expand Around Center)**
   Time Complexity: **O(n²)**
   Space Complexity: **O(1)**

### Approach I: Dynamic Programming

In this approach, we aim to check all substrings of the string. Specifically, we will check substrings of lengths 1, 2, 3, ..., up to `len(s)`.

We use a 2D array `dp` of size `n x n` where `n` is the length of the string. The rows represent the starting index, and the columns represent the length of the substring. For example, `dp[5][7]` represents the substring starting at index 5 with a length of 7.

For `dp[i][length]` to be `True`, the following conditions need to be satisfied:
1. The first and last characters of the substring must be the same (`s[i] == s[i + length]`).
2. The middle substring (between the first and last characters) must also be a palindrome (`dp[i+1][length-2]`).

#### Base Cases:
1. All single-character substrings are palindromes:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(s)):
       dp[i][0] = True
       count[0] += 1
    # Check for two-character palindromes:
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if s[i] == s[i+1]:
            dp[i][1] = True
            count[0] += 1

## Explanation of DP Filling

When computing `dp[i][length]`, where `length` represents the length of the substring we are evaluating, we follow these conditions:

1. **First Condition**: The first and last characters of the substring must be the same. This is checked using:
   ```python
   s[i] == s[i + length]
This condition ensures that the characters at the starting index i and the index i + length are identical.

2. **Second Condition**: The middle substring (the portion of the substring that excludes the first and last characters) must also be a palindrome. This is checked with:
    ```python
    dp[i + 1][length - 2]
Here, i + 1 is the starting index of the middle substring, and length - 2 represents its length. If this condition is True, it indicates that the substring formed by excluding the first and last characters is also a palindrome.

Thus, for dp[i][length] to be True, both conditions must be satisfied. If they are, we can increment our count of palindromic substrings


## Base Case Code

The base cases for the DP table are established as follows:

1. **Single-Character Substrings**: All single-character substrings are palindromes. This is represented in the DP table by setting `dp[i][0]` to `True` for all valid indices `i`. We also increment the count of palindromic substrings.

   ```python
   def baseCasesForDP(self, dp: list[list[bool]], s: str, count: list[int]) -> None:
       for i in range(len(s)):
           dp[i][0] = True
           count[0] += 1

        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] == s[i+1]:
                dp[i][1] = True
                count[0] += 1


## DP Initialization
We initialize the dp array and a count list to track the number of palindromes:
    ```python
    # Variable initialization
    rows = len(s)
    cols = len(s)
    count = [0]  # List to store the count (as integers are immutable in Python)

    # DP Initialization
    dp = []
    for i in range(rows):
        t = [False] * cols
        dp.append(t)

## Filling the DP Table

We then fill the DP table for substrings of length 3 and above:

```python
length = 2
for length in range(2, len(s)):
    for i in range(len(s) - length):
        if s[i] == s[i + length] and dp[i + 1][length - 2] == True:
            dp[i][length] = True
            count[0] += 1
